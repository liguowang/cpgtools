CpG_anno_position.py
=====================

Description
------------

This program adds annotation information to each CpG based on its **genomic position**.

Notes
------

- Input CpG (-i) and annotation (-a) BED files must have at least three columns, and must based on the same genome assembly   version
- If multiple regions from the annotation BED file are overlapped with the **same**
  CpG site, their names will be concatenated together.
- Since the input (-i) is a regular BED foramt file, this module can be uesd to annotate any genomic regions of interest.

	Chromatin State Segmentation by `chromHMM <https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1906>`_

	types (GM12878, H1-hESC, K562, HepG2, HUVEC, HMEC, HSMM, NHEK, NHLF) were learned by
	integrating 9 factors (CTCF, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1,
	H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H4K20me1 ) plus input. A total of 15 states were identified,
	include: State-1 (Active Promoter), state-2 (Weak Promoter), state-3 (Inactive/poised
	Promoter), state-4 and 5 (Strong enhancer), state-6 and 7 (Weak/poised enhancer),
	state-8 (insulator), state-9 (Transcriptional transition), state-10 (Transcriptional
	elongation), state-11 (Weak transcribed), state-12 (Polycomb-repressed), state-13
	(Heterochromatin or low signal), state-14 and 15 (Repetitive/Copy Number Variation).
